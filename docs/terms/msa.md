Mail Submission Agent (MSA) is an SMTP (or API) server that accepts emails for delivery from authenticated users.

If a email service provider lists details for a SMTP server to use for sending emails, then this is a MSA server.

- `smtp.office365.com` on port 587
- `smtp.sendgrid.net` on port 465
- etc

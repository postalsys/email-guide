# About

Hello there! I'm [Andris Reinman](https://github.com/andris9), the developer behind renowned open-source email projects, including [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/).

Over the years, I've been approached by numerous SaaS service and startup builders seeking guidance on integrating email sending capabilities into their platforms. While every scenario has its nuances, I've observed a pattern: the solutions, more often than not, share similarities. The world of email sending isn't as vast and complicated as it might seem at first glance.

Recognizing the recurring challenges and the consistent solutions, I felt compelled to create this guide. Here, on this website, I've distilled my knowledge and experience to present a comprehensive overview of the various email sending options available. Whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your approach, I hope this guide proves invaluable in your email integration journey.

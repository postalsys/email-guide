# Introduction

Transactional emails are automated messages sent to individuals based on specific actions or events they've triggered. Unlike marketing emails, which are promotional in nature and sent to a list of subscribers, transactional emails are tailored to an individual's interaction with a platform or service. They are often critical for the user experience and play a pivotal role in maintaining user trust and engagement.

Where are transactional emails most suitable? They shine in scenarios where immediate feedback or confirmation is essential. For instance, after signing up for a new service, users expect a welcome or verification email. This not only confirms their successful registration but also sets the tone for their relationship with the brand. Similarly, when making an online purchase, receiving an order confirmation email reassures the buyer that their transaction was successful.

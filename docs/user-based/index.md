# Introduction

Emails sent on behalf of users represent a unique category of communication, where a system or service sends out messages as if they're originating directly from an individual user. Unlike transactional or marketing emails, which are typically from businesses to users, these emails act as a proxy, allowing for automated yet personalized interactions between users or between a user and their contacts.

The concept behind this approach is to facilitate seamless communication without the direct involvement of the sender. For instance, a SaaS platform might send out negotiation emails to potential clients, making it appear as if they're coming directly from a sales representative. Or, a booking system might send appointment reminders to clients, seemingly from the service provider.

# General Advice

In the rapidly evolving world of SaaS, it's essential to recognize the boundaries of your platform's capabilities and the expertise of your team. If your SaaS service isn't primarily focused on email solutions, it's advisable not to venture into implementing marketing email functionalities.

Why? Because email marketing is a specialized domain that requires nuanced understanding and strategy. At first glance, marketing emails might appear as a mere technical challenge, but in reality, they are deeply rooted in marketing strategy and are best managed by marketing professionals, not the development team. Unless you're building an email service and are keen on dogfooding it, it's best to leave the intricacies of email marketing to the experts in that field.

Instead, your SaaS platform should prioritize creating robust integrations, such as relaying information about new sign-ups or other pertinent events to dedicated marketing tools. This approach empowers your marketing team, allowing them to select the best tools tailored for their needs. By doing so, they can craft effective drip campaigns and other targeted strategies, ensuring that your marketing efforts are both efficient and impactful.

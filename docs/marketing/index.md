# Introduction

Marketing emails are strategically crafted messages designed to promote a product, service, or brand to a specific audience. Unlike transactional emails, which are reactive and sent in response to user actions, marketing emails are proactive, aiming to engage, inform, or persuade recipients. They play a crucial role in nurturing leads, building brand loyalty, and driving sales.

The term "marketing" in this context encapsulates a wide variety of email types. This includes newsletters that update subscribers about company news or industry trends, promotional emails offering discounts or special deals, and drip campaigns that guide potential customers through a journey with the aim of conversion. Each type serves a unique purpose, but all share the common goal of enhancing brand visibility and fostering a deeper connection with the audience.
